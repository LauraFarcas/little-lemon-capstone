            Little Lemon started as an unexpected adventure by Mia, a retired traveler who fell in love with global
             flavors during her journeys. Inspired by vibrant Mediterranean cuisine, she returned to Chicago with a mission:
              to bring authentic tastes from around the world to her community. She teamed up with local, self-taught cooks to craft
             a menu rich with cultural diversity.
             Today, Little Lemon is a cozy haven where each dish offers a journey through global traditions, 
             inviting diners to savor the flavors of distant lands in the heart of Chicago.
